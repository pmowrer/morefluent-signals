# morefluent-signals 
***
morefluent-signals is an extension library for morefluent, an AS3 library that makes event testing much less of a drag. With morefluent-signals, all of the morefluent goodness is now compatible with Rob Penner's as3-signals.

morefluent-signals makes use of [as3-signals-utilities-async](https://github.com/eidiot/as3-signals-utilities-async/) (baked-in), and depends on [morefluent](https://bitbucket.org/loomis/morefluent/wiki/Home), [as3-signals](https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals) and [hamcrest-as3](https://github.com/drewbourne/hamcrest-as3) (you'll have to get those yourself). It's been tested to be compatible with morefluent 1.2M8, as3-signals 0.8 and hamcrest 1.1.1.
